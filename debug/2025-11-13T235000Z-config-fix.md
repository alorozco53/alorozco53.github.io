# Configuration Fix - 2025-11-13

## Issue
The presentation prototype button was not visible and the presentation page was not being generated.

## Root Cause
YAML syntax error in `_config.yml` at line 213. The `presentations` default scope was incorrectly indented as a child of the previous scope's `values:` block instead of being a sibling scope at the same level as other default scopes.

### Before (Incorrect):
```yaml
defaults:
  -
    scope:
      path: "" # all files
    values:
      layout: "page"
      show-avatar: true
    -                           # ← Wrong indentation!
      scope:
        path: ""
        type: "presentations"
```

### After (Correct):
```yaml
defaults:
  -
    scope:
      path: "" # all files
    values:
      layout: "page"
      show-avatar: true
  -                            # ← Correct indentation
    scope:
      path: ""
      type: "presentations"
```

## Fix Applied
Fixed the indentation of the `presentations` default scope in `_config.yml` to be at the correct YAML level (as a sibling list item in the `defaults` array, not nested under the previous scope's values).

## Verification
- ✅ YAML syntax validated with Python's yaml parser
- ✅ All presentation infrastructure files exist:
  - `_layouts/reveal.html`
  - `_includes/presentation/head.html`
  - `_includes/presentation/navbar.html`
  - `_includes/presentation/scripts.html`
  - `css/presentations.css`
- ✅ Prototype presentation exists: `_presentations/standardization-prototype.html`
- ✅ Button code present in `index.html` (lines 41-50)
- ✅ Logo file exists: `img/centraal_logo_blanco.png`
- ✅ Collection configured in `_config.yml`

## Expected Result
When Jekyll builds the site:
1. The `presentations` collection will be properly processed
2. The prototype presentation will be generated at `/presentations/standardization-prototype/`
3. The button on the homepage will link to the working presentation
4. The presentation will use the `reveal` layout with all configured plugins and navigation chrome

## Testing Recommendation
1. Build the site with `bundle exec jekyll serve` or `docker-compose up`
2. Visit the homepage and verify the blue button appears
3. Click the button to navigate to `/presentations/standardization-prototype/`
4. Verify the presentation loads with navigation chrome (back button, debug link, logo)
