<h1>
Who am I?
</h1>
</center>

My name's _Albert_, I am originally from Guadalajara, MÃ©xico and
I enjoy all things _artificial intelligence_. ðŸ˜Ž

Currently, I am a <a href="https://i.redd.it/00jpphto36f31.jpg" target="blank_">Research Master's student</a> at 
<a href="https://mila.quebec/en/" target="blank_">Mila - QuÃ©bec AI Institute</a> and the
<a href="http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca" target="blank_">Reasoning and Learning Lab</a> of
<a href="https://mcgill.ca" target="blank_">McGill University</a> under
<a href="http://www.reirab.com" target="blank_">Prof Reihaneh Rabbany</a>'s supervision.

My current research interests rely in the intersection of Network Science and Natural Language Processing.

I have a broad spectrum of interests in **AI**:
from the theoretical foundations of deep learning to
applications regarding _NLP_, _chatbots_, and _social networks_.

My current goals are directed towards enhancing
how humans and machines communicate and understand themselves,
as well as providing elegant models for such tasks.
