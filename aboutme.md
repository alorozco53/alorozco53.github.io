<h1>
Who am I?
</h1>
</center>

My name's _Albert_, I am originally from Guadalajara, Mexico and
I enjoy all things _artificial intelligence_. ðŸ˜Ž

I have a broad spectrum of interests in **AI**:
from the theoretical foundations of deep learning to
applications regarding _NLP_, _chatbots_, and _social networks_.

My current goals are directed towards enhancing
how humans and machines communicate and understand themselves,
as well as providing elegant models for such tasks.
