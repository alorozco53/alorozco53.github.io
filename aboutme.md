## Who am I?

My name is **Albert Manuel Orozco Camacho**; I am originally from Guadalajara, Jalisco, México 🇲🇽.

> 👁️👁 ️My last name is **Orozco Camacho**. As a proud Latin American, I strongly prefer to use
[both words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_customs_of_Hispanic_America) on any context. I consider these
subtleities as important heritage markers, and am often curious about the naming customs of other cultures.

I enjoy all things _artificial intelligence_. 😎

## Present-days: Doing a PhD at Mila and Concordia University

----------------

## Previously: Research Master's at Mila and McGill University

In the past, I was a <a href="https://i.redd.it/00jpphto36f31.jpg" target="blank_">Research Master's student</a> at 
<a href="https://mila.quebec/en/" target="blank_">Mila - Québec AI Institute</a> and the
<a href="http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca" target="blank_">Reasoning and Learning Lab</a> of
<a href="https://mcgill.ca" target="blank_">McGill University</a> under
<a href="http://www.reirab.com" target="blank_">Prof Reihaneh Rabbany</a>'s supervision.

My current research interests rely in the intersection of Network Science and Natural Language Processing.

I have a broad spectrum of interests in **AI**:
from the theoretical foundations of deep learning to
applications regarding _NLP_, _chatbots_, and _social networks_.

My current goals are directed towards enhancing
how humans and machines communicate and understand themselves,
as well as providing elegant models for such tasks.

## What happened before? 🤔 Undergrad degree at UNAM!
