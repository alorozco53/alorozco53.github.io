## Who am I?

My name is **Albert Manuel Orozco Camacho**; I am originally from Guadalajara, Jalisco, México 🇲🇽.

> 👁️👁 ️My last name is **Orozco Camacho**. As a proud Latin American, I strongly prefer to use
[both words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_customs_of_Hispanic_America) on any context, especially on 
academic publications. I consider these subtleities as important heritage markers,
and am often curious about the naming customs of other cultures.

I enjoy all things _artificial intelligence_. 😎

## Present-days: Doing a PhD at Mila and Concordia University

----------------

## Previously: Research Master's at Mila and McGill University

In 2022, I completed a <a href="https://i.redd.it/00jpphto36f31.jpg" target="blank_">Master's degree</a> at 
<a href="https://mila.quebec/en/" target="blank_">Mila</a> and the
<a href="http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca" target="blank_">Reasoning and Learning Lab</a> of
<a href="https://mcgill.ca" target="blank_">McGill University</a>, under
Prof <a href="http://www.reirab.com" target="blank_">Reihaneh Rabbany</a>'s supervision.
It all started on 2019, about 9 months before the SARS-COV-2 pandemic hit 🦠.

During that time, I worked in the intersection of Network Science and Natural Language Processing.

## What happened before? 🤔 Undergrad degree at UNAM!

I did my undergrad at the <a href="https://fciencias.unam.mx" target="blank_">Facultad de Ciencias</a> of the
<a href="https://www.unam.mx" target="blank_">Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México</a> (UNAM).
I graduated in 2018 with a degree in Computer Science.

During this time, I was very happy to work under Dr <a href="https://turing.iimas.unam.mx/~ivanvladimir/en/" target="blank_">Ivan Vladimir Meza Ruiz</a>'s guidance. Under him, I worked on several speech and language processing projects, which derived into teaching experiences, hackathons, and a <a href="/publications">publication</a>.

Before I started playing with modern-day language models, I spent a year playing with <a href="http://golem.iimas.unam.mx/home.php?lang=en&sec=home" target="blank_">IIMAS' Golem</a> service robot. This was a very wholesome experience that allowed me to to learn the essence of AI before the Deep Learning boom.

My undergraduate concluded with a _famous_ dissertation in which I was able to showcase a bit of my flippant side
towards the academic world. I deeply believe that humans shall seek any degree of joy in their professional activities; and moreover, it is worth taking one's life a bit less seriously, from time to time.

This was a very early effort to creating coherent meme captions, given some popular 2010s characters.
It was based on the _Show-and-Tell_ model, which was a precursor to the modern-day _Image Captioning_ models.
It combined a pre-trained InceptionV3 model (on ImageNet) with an LSTM for text generation.
